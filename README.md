## Question
NYU Shanghai is preparing to interview new candidates of the undergraduate program. There are N students
entering the interview process, and NYU Shanghai has formed an interview committee of M faculty. Each student
will be interviewed by 4 faculty members (let’s call this body of one student and four faculty an interview group),
where the faculty come up with their own questions during each interview. To ensure a relatively fair interview
process, NYU Shanghai has the following requirement:

• R1. Each faculty member interviews similar amount of students;

• R2. Two interview groups cannot have 4 identical interviewing faculty;

• R3. Two interview groups having 2-3 identical interviewing faculty should be avoided;

• R4. The number of students being interviewed by any pair of faculty members should be as small as possible.

Try to design an interviewing schedule and answer the following questions:

• Q1. Assuming you know the total number of students N, what is the least amount of faculty M needed if no interview group contains more than 1 identical interviewing faculty?

• Q2. Design an interview process that satisfies R1-R4, try to apply your model to the case N = 379, M = 24.

• Q3. Consider other factors that might affect the fairness of interview process, and propose modification to
your model to include such considerations
